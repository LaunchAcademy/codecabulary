<!-- ---title: Fetch vs. Key Lookup -->

If you're building data off of data provided by another company or software, you might not know how rigorous they've been with their collection process, so you should make sure you _are_ rigorous in ensuring you don't store garbage data.

In this case, looking up data on an imported will return `nil` values for keys that don't exist, for instance:

	auth[:user][:first_name]
	nil
	
Whereas `fetch` will raise a `KeyError`, forcing you to catch the error before you store it:

	auth[:user].fetch(:first_name)
	> KeyError
	
This will keep us from making assumptions about data we don't have, and causing bugs in seemingly unrelated parts of our code.
