## Starting A Git Project

Git is a version control system that takes snapshots of an entire filesystem over time. As you reach a good stopping point (perhaps you've finished a new feature), you _commit_, or record those changes to the file system along with a message to help you and your team to remember what changes were made in that version and why.

There are two primary ways to start a Git repo: 1) To start tracking a new or existing, untracked project in Git, or 2) To clone an existing Git repo from another server.

#### Git Init

To start tracking a new or existing project in Git, enter the project's directory via the command line and enter:

	git init
	
`git init` creates a new subdirectory in the root named `.git` that contains your repo files, although you haven't begun tracking anything yet. Git is very obedient in terms of tracking changes, and will only record the changes you tell it to. We'll explore how to track these changes in the Git Lifecycle section below.

#### Git Clone

Your colleague already has a Git repo that you'd like to begin working on. Great. Enter the terminal and enter:

	git clone [url]
	
Where other VCSes `checkout` the latest copy of a repo, `git clone` copies every version of every file in the history of the project. No one needs to rely on the server's copy of the repo, or your klutzy friend Andy's copy of the repo (he's always spilling lemonades on his computer). With `git clone`, if one version of the repo is corrupted, you can use any of the clones to get the repo back in top shape.

	git clone git://github.com/user/directory.git
	
The command above creates a new directory on your computer (named `directory` in this example), creates a `.git` directory inside of it, pulls down the data for the repo and checks out a working copy of the latest version. 

	git clone git://github.com/user/directory.git whatever_i_want
	
This command does the same thing, except it names the directory `whatever_i_want` instead of `directory`.
