<!-- ---title: Creating A Good GitHub Page -->

A good GitHub profile consists of three types of files:

* How Tos, Style Guides, and Examples
* Libraries, gems, and other bootstrappers
* Finished apps

In general, you want your GitHub page to showcase your talents and work you've done to give back to the community. These three types of files do that well. 

Let's examine [ThoughtBot's GitHub account](https://github.com/thoughtbot) to see these three filetypes in action.

* Examples of How Tos, Style Guides, and Examples:
	* [Guide to Programming in Style](https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides)
	* [Example of Agile Development through a Heroku App (as part of a webinar](https://github.com/thoughtbot/webinar))
* Examples of Libraries, Gems, and Bootstrappers:
	* [Bourbon: A Mixin Library for Sass](https://github.com/thoughtbot/bourbon)
	* [Dotfiles](https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles)
	* [Paperclip: A Library for Active Record](https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip)
* Examples of Finished Apps (you know what these look like):
	* [Paperclip Example App](https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip_demo)
	
With these three types of files, you'll also achieve an active commit history--another emblem of a strong GitHub page.

Some other examples of strong GitHub pages include;

* [Terrible Labs](https://github.com/terriblelabs)
* [General Assembly](https://github.com/generalassembly)
* [Vermonster](https://github.com/Vermonster)
